# Influence of audio augmentation techniques on STT systems.
This project investigates the impact of audio augmentation techniques on low-resource languages. For this purpose, various models were trained and compared using the same training data, but with different augmentation techniques. The Common Voice dataset was used as training data, which was artificially reduced to 41 hours in order to simulate a low-resource language.
